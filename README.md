# uta-machine-learning
This is my Machine learning Project. In this project I tried to detect ball in cricket match clip or in a short video. I also tried to predict the path of the ball where it is moving.

## Approached Used:
* Image pre-processing, resizing to 
* Image Segmentation
* Contour Detection
* Random Forest Classifier for classifying the identified contours into ball(Class 0) and not ball(Class 1) patches.
